* Parse and consider `symbol' syntax in docstrings. See: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DocString.
* Consider using Shinmera's "definitions" library instead of "def-properties".
* Improve description buffers for CLOS classes. Show more information about slots to begin with.
* Consider showing type information, like the normal Common Lisp describe function does.
